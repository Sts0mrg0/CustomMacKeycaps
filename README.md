Custom Mac Keycaps
================
This is a set of keycap templates with Apple keyboard layout. They are designed for Cherry MX mechanical keyboards and based on [Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa). Vendors who build custom mechanical keyboards can use these templates to print custom keycaps. My personal favorite vendor is [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com). 

## A Little Bit History
Back in November 2011, I was looking for a mechanical keyboard for my mac. However, it was so hard to find a perfect keyboard with mac layout back then. Finally I decided to create my own based on [the work of a GeekHack user](http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=23203.0). 

After I published the final result with screenshots on [my blog](http://www.clingmarks.com/custom-mac-mechanical-keyboard-lets-have-some-fun/893) and [GeekHack](http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=24121.0), I received many positive feedbacks and requests for the template files. I initially hosted them on my blog. However, since my server crashes sometime, I decided to move them here from now on.

## How To
1. Download the .ai files from this repository.
2. The two .ai files are pretty much the same except one has a "Pig King" logo on the space bar.
3. Feel free to modify it to suit your needs.
2. Go to your favorite vendor and create a keycap set based on the .ai file you chose. Use WASD Keyboard as an example, just go to [this page](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/104-key-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html) and upload your .ai file.
3. Once you have the keyboard, you need to map the keys to the labled functions. I use [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) for that. The software used to be called **KeyRemap4MacBook**.
4. My configuration file for the key mapping is [private.xml](https://github.com/ychw/CustomMacKeycaps/blob/master/private.xml).

## Other Alternatives
Nowadays, there are more and more native Mac mechanical keyboards. For example:
* [Matias Tactile Pro 3](http://matias.ca/tactilepro3/)
* [DAS Model S Professional for Mac](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional-for-mac/)
* [Happy Hacking Professional 2](https://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2): this is actually not a Cherry MX keyboard; instead, it has "**electrostatic capacitive switches**". It supports Mac very well natively. I am currently using one and love it!
